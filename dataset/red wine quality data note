Target variable: quality

In the original data there are six values for the target variable, 
integer numbers ranging from 3 to 8. 

The target variable has been reclassified in four values:
the values 3 and 4 have been put together in class "4"
the values 7 and 8 have been put together in class "7"

The folder contains three datasets:

train data: about 60% of the units of the original dataset
validation data: about 20% of the units of the original dataset
test data: about 20% of the units of the original dataset

The test set does not contain the target variable. The true values of the target variable will be discussed during the exam.

Index of the report:

1. Exploratory data analysis of the train data set
2. Modeling the train data according to three different approaches
   a. discriminant analysis
   b. random forests
   c. neural networks
3. Compare the results and choose the best model
4. Apply the model to the test data and predict the target values
5. Provide the file of the test data with the predicted values
