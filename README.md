# Red wine quality
Statistical model in R to predict wine quality. In this project I used the red wine dataset in Kaggle, I created three models: "LDA", "Random Forest", "Neural Network" and based on results of confusion matrix I chose the best model. then I predicted the future value using chosen model.
For more info please read the documentation and all the codes are inside R note book.
